            Over 1 billion people worldwide live with mental disorders, like anxiety and depression, making these the
            world's leading causes of disability and health-related economic loss.
            The problem has been becoming more popular since 2011, with affected individuals increasing faster than the
            world population.
            Also, suicide has claimed about 700,000 lives in 2021, with it being one of the top causes of death when it
            comes to young people worldwide.
            The economic impact is severe as well; depression and anxiety has costed the global economy roughly 1
            trillion in US dollars annually in lost productivity.
            Yet despite the impact this issue has done, governments still allocate about 2% of their health budget to
            mental health, with low-income countries having fewer than one mental health professional for every 100,000
            people.

            In the Philippines, the burden on mental health problems is equally, if not more, concerning.
            Depression and anxiety are unfortunately spread widely across the Philippines; 3.3 million Filipinos and 4.5
            million suffer from depression and anxiety disorders, respectively.
            Among the Filipino youth, which is 15 to 24 years old, the people experiencing depressive symptoms from
            moderate to severe have doubled, from 9.6% in 2013, to 20.9% in 2021,
            with sharper increases in women, LGBTQ+ youth, and groups with an economical disadvantage.
            The country has another issue related to mental health as well; the lack of professionals. In 2022, there
            were roughly 500 psychiatrists, 1,000 psychologists, 500 psychiatric nurses, and
            1,200 social workers, including about 60 child psychiatrists, serving over 110 million Filipinos.
            Even with the 2010 Mental Health Act, that promised broader access to services, even at barangay level, the
            law remains underfunded, and struggles with implementation, especially in rural and marginalized areas.

            Globally, the World Health Organization is calling for stronger mental health systems; scaling up
            community-based, person-centered care, increasing funds, deploying more trained and experienced
            professionals,
            reforming laws, and making sure treatment is given to everyone; not just the privileged. Many countries have
            updated and further improved their mental health policies
            and emergency preparedness, and over 80% of countries now include mental health support within emergency
            response efforts; a big improvement from 39% in 2020.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the Philippines, big and significant steps have also been made, with the 2018 Mental Health Act, or
            Republic Act 11036, which aims for protecting the rights of people
            with mental health conditions and broadening the access to services, including training for professionals in
            health and integration into primary care.
            The National Mental Health Program under the Department of Health promotes awareness, training, services,
            research, and partnerships, with organizations like the
            Philippine Mental Health Association and the National Center for Mental Health. The World Health
            Organization's Mental Health Gap Action Program, or whGAP, has
            trained members in over a thousand goverment units, to recognize and manage issues about mental health
            issues, and digital tools, like apps and web platforms,
            have expanded access, especially during the pandemic.

    <h1>
        How I'll Contribute;
    </h1>
    <p>
        I'll put articles (and credit the authors of course) that talk about mental health in general on my
        site, including culturally sensitive situations, so that people who relate or are experiencing the same
        can be seen, heard, and understood.
        I'll also give practical tools, like journaling prompts, relaxation techniques, and the like, that
        people can use daily.
        I'll include hotlines, therapy services, and local or community resources. Last, I'll highlight personal
        stories, interviews, and blog posts, from people with lived experiences, to encourage others that
        seeking help and sharing your personal stories can be a sign of strength.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center; ">
