I can't be your love
Look it's too trivial for you now

Oh my life's fallin apart
Maybe no one will know if I disappear

But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I'll give you all my life my seasons

I can't be your love
Cause I'm afraid I'll ruin your life
While the leaves withered away
And grew again
You have gone far away

I'll be pushing up daisies
And bring all the chances to here

But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I'll give you all my life my seasons
By your side I'll be your seasons

My love
    </p></pre>
